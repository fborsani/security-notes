# AWS Infrastructure

## Access Control

### Accounts

ï»¿An AWS account is a container for your AWS resources. AWS accounts are designated by a 12-digit unique number known as an Account ID (XXXX-XXXX-XX). AWS accounts are used together with IAM (access control) and AWS Identity to create a security boundary around a specific user by defining roles and allowed actions.

### AWS Root account

To sign up for an AWS account, AWS users provide a root user e-mail address. An e-mail address can only be used as the root user e-mail address for one AWS account. The root user is considered an IAM "superuser" and has complete administrative permissions against the AWS account.&#x20;

By default, root users do not have multi-factor authentication (MFA) enforced. Furthermore, root accounts that do not have MFA enabled or a phone number set are susceptible to a weak password reset workflow attack. This is commonly the case for AWS accounts created automatically using the AWS Organizations service. If an attacker gains control of the e-mail inbox for an AWS root user without MFA or a phone number on the account, the attacker will be able to send a password reset e-mail and complete a takeover of the targeted AWS account.

#### Authentication

The authentication procedure is composed by elements called Principals. These elements are used to define access rules to services and resources. A principal falls into one of the following categories:

* **Users**: represent a person or an application.  IAM Users are linked to a single AWS Account
* **Groups**:
* **Roles**:
* **Policies**:
